This repository contains an attempt at converting a speech recognition model made in keras to tensorflow which then can
be optimized to IR representation and used for inference against wav files similar to Udacity AIND Capstone.
It appears that OpenVino does not support translation of one of the rnn multiplication layers out of the box and custom layers needs to be made

This repository will be updated iteratively

(All commands are in jupyter notebook)
